# Reviewing OCA Concepts
- The OCP questions are a lot tougher than the OCA questions. Really need to know the fundamentals covered in the next 5 sections. After that the book moves onto the new topics such as instanceOf, implement equals/hashCode/toString, Enums and nested classes.

## Access Modifiers
These are private, no modifier(the default or aka package-private), protected and public:
- **private**: Only accessible within the class.
- **no modifier**: Is the default and used if any other access modifier keyword is missing. Only code in the same package can access code with default access.
- **protected**: It allows subclasses and code in the same package to access members. If in a different package, the member is only accessible through inheritance otherwise it errors.
- **public**: Any code can access public members.

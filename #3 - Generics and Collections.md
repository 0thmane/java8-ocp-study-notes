# Reviewing OCA Collections
The *Java Collection Framework* includes classes that implement List, Map, Queue, and Set. On the OCA, we saw ArrayList.  We also saw arrays in the OCA as in ```int[]```. An array is not part of the Collection Framework. Since sorting and searching are similar these are covered in the exam. OCP is cumulative and that means that you are expected to know how to work with arrays from the OCA. In the following we are going to revise arrays, ArrayLists, wrapper classes, autoboxing, the diamond operator, searching and sorting.

## Array and ArrayList
An arrayList is an object that contains other objects. An ArrayList cannot contain primitives. An array is a built-in data structure that contains other objects or primitives. See examples of both below:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();      //empty list
list.add("Fluffy");                         //[Fluffy]
list.add("Webby");                          //[fluffy,Webby]

String[] array = new String[list.size()];   // empty array
array[0] = list.get(1);                     // [Webby]
array[1] = list.get(0);                     // [Webby, Fluffy]
```

Now, review the link created when converting between an array and ArrayList:

```java
String[] array = {"gerbil","mouse"};            // [gerbil,mouse]
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array)        // returns a fixed size list
list.set(1,"test")                              // [gerbil,test]
array[0] = "new";                               // [new,test]
String[] array2 = (String[]) list.toArray();    // [new, test]
list.remove(1);                                 // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
```

Line 2 converts an array to a List. Since we used asList() to make the convertion the created list is not resizable. Line 5 converts the List back to an array. Finally, the last line shows that list is not resizable because it is backed by the underlying array. 

## Searching and Sorting
```java
int[] numbers = {6,9,1,8};  
Arrays.sort(numbers);                                         //[1,6,8,9]
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers,6));  //1
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers,3));  //-2

Line 2 sorts the array because Binary Search assumes the input is sorted. Line 3 prints the index at which match is found. Line 4 prints one less than the negated  of where the requested value would need to be inserted. The number 3 would need to inserted at index 1 (after the number 1 but before the number 6) so index 1. Negating that index give us -1 and substracting 1 gives us -2.

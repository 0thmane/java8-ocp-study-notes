NIO.2 is an acronym that stands for the second version of the Non-blocking Input/Output API, and it is sometimes referred to as "New I/O".

# Introducing NIO.2
Java introduced a replacement for java.io streams in Java 1.4 called Non-blocking I/O or NIO for short. The NIO API introduced the concept of buffers and channels in place of java.io streams. The basic idea is that you load the data from a file channel into a temporary buffer that, unlike byte streams, can be read forward and backward without blocking on the underlying resource. Unfortunately, the NIO API was never particularly popular, so much so that nothing for the original version NIO will be on the OCP exam. This book is geared towards teaching you NIO.2. Java 7 introduced the NIO.2 API. While the NIO API was intended to a replacement for java.io streams, the NIO.2 API is actually a replacement for the java.io.File class and related interactions. The goal of the NIO.2 API implementation is to provide a more intuitive, more feature rich API for working with files. As you shall see in this chapter, it also provides a number of notable performance improvements over the exisiting java.io.File class.

## Introducing Path
The java.nio.file.Path interface, is the primary entry point for working with the NIO.2 API. A Path object represents a hierarchical path on the storage system to a file or a directory. In this manner, Path is a direct replacement for the legacy java.io.File class, and conceptually contains many of the same properties. Unlike the File class, the Path interface contains support for symbolic links. A *symbolic link* is a special file within an operating system that servers as a reference or pointer to another file or directory. The NIO.2 API includes full support for creating, detecting, and navigating symbolic links within the file system.

### Creating Instances with Factory and Helper Classes
For example you can create an instance of a Path interface using a static method available in the Path's factory class. Note the 's' at the end of Path class to distunguish it from the Path interface. The reason why Path is an interface and not a class is that creating a file or a drectory is considered a file system dependant task in NIO.2. When you obtain a Path object from the default file system in NIO.2, the JVM gives you back an object that unlike java.io.File transparently handless system specific details for the current platform. If you didn't use the factory pattern to create an instance, you would have to know what the underlying file system was and use this in every create method.

NIO.2 also includes helper classes such as java.nio.file.Files, whose primary purpose is to operate on instances of Path objects. Helper or utility classes are similar factory classes in that they are often composed primarily of static methods that operate on a particular class. They differ in that helper classes are focused on manipulating or creating new objects from existing instances, whereas factory classes are focused primarily on object creation. You should become confortable with this paradigm, if you are not already, as most of your interactions with NIO.2 API will require accessing at least two classes: an interface and a factory helper class. As a guideline for this section, we present the NIO.2 class and interface relationship in the figure below.

![NIO2 class and interface Relationships](img/NIO2classInterfaceRelationship.png)

## Creating Paths
Since path is an interface you need a factory class to create instances of one. The NIO.2 API provides a number of classes and methods that you can use to create  Path objects, which we will review in this section.

### Using the Path Class
The simplest and most straightforward way to obtain a Path object is using the java.nio.files.Paths factory class, or Paths for short. To obtain a reference to a file or directory, you would call the static method Paths.getPath(String) method, as shown in the following example:

```
Path path1 = Paths.get("pandas/cuddly.png");

Path path2 = Paths.get("c:\\zooinfo\\November\\employees.txt");

Path path3 = Paths.get("/home/zoodirector");

```
The first example creates a Path reference to a relative file in current working directory. The second example creates a Path reference to an absolute file in a Windows-based system. The third example creates a Path reference  to an absolute directory in a Linux or Mac based system.

You can also create a Path usoing the Paths class using a vararg of type String such as Paths.get(Stirng, String...). This allows you create a Path from a list of String valuesin which the operating system-dependant path.separator is automatically inserted between elements. As you may remember from Chapter 8, System.getProperty("path.separator") can be used to get the operating system dependent file separator from the JVM. That said, most JVM implementations support both forward and backward slashes regadless of the file system, allowing the same code to run on multiple operating systems without having to rewrite the slashes.

```
Path path1 = Paths.get("pandas", "cuddly.png");

Path path2 = Paths.get("c:","zooinfo","November","employees.txt");

Path path3 = Paths.get("/","home","zoodirector");

```

These examples are rewritten of your previous set of Path examples, using the param list of String values instead of a single String values. The advantage of using this overloaded method is that it is more robust when manually constructing path values, as it inserts the proper separator for you.

Note that be wary of Path vs Paths on the exam. Java is fond of using one name for the class and the plural form of the name for the for the factory or the helper class. When you see questions with Path or Paths on the exam, be sure that the class reference and usage are correct. For example, the following usage is incorrect and will not compile:

```
Paths path1 = Paths.get("/alligator/swim.txt");     //DOES NOT COMPILE

Path path2 = Path.get("/crocodile/food.csv");       //DOES NOT COMPILE

```
The key point to remeber is that the singular for of Path represents the instance with which you want to work, whereas the plural form of Paths is the factory classes containing methods for creating Path instances.

Another way to construct a Path using the Paths class is with URI value. A *uniform resource indetifier (URI)* is a string of characters that indetify a resource. It begins with a schema that indicates the resource type, followed by a path value. Examples of schema values includes file://, http://, https://, and ftp://. The java.net.URI class is used to create and manage UNI values.

```
Path path1 = Paths.get(new URI("file://pandas/cuddly.png"));    //THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME

Path path2 = Paths.get(new URI("file:///c:/zoo-info/November/employees.txt"));

Path path3 = Paths.get(new URI("file:///home/zoodirectory"));

```

These examples show how the Paths.get(URI) method can be used to obtain a reference to a URI-based resource. Notice that these are actually rewrites of our earlier examples, as we can use URI values for both local and network paths. The first example actually throws an exception at runtime, as URIs must reference absolute paths at runtime. The URI class. The UNI class does have an isAbsolute() method, although this is related to whether or not UNI has a schema, not the file location.

We now present two additional methods that uese other types of non-local file system schemas. For the exam, you do not need to know the syntax of these schemas, but you should be aware that they exist:

```
Path path4 = Paths.get(new URI("http://www.wiley.com"));

Path path5 = Paths.get(new URI("ftp://username:password@ftp.the-ftp-server.com"));

```

Note that the constructor new URI(String) does not throw a checked URISyntaxException, which would have to be caught in any application where the previous code snippets are used. Finally the Path interface also contains a reciprocal method toUri() for converting a Path instance back to a URI instance, as shown in the following sample of code:

```
Path path4 = Paths.get(new URI("http://www.wiley.com"));
URI uri4 = path4.toUri(); 
```

### Accesing the Underlying FileSystem Object
The Paths.get() method used throughout the previous example is actually shorthand for the class java.nio.file.FileSystem method getPath(). The FileSystem class has a protected constructor, so we use the plural FileSystem factory class to obtain an instance of FileSystem, as shown in the following example code:

```
Path path1 = FileSystems.geDefault().getPath("pandas/cuddly.png");

Path path2 = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("c:","zooinfo", "November","employees.txt");

Path path3 = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("/home/zoodirector");

```

Again, we are able to rewrite our previous set of examples, with this code behaving in the exact same manner as before. While most of the time we want access to a Path object that is within the local file system, the FileSystems factory class does give us the ability to connect to a remote file system, as shown in the following sample code:

```
FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.getFileSystem(new URI("http://www.selikoff.net"));

Path path = fileSystem.getPath("duck.txt");
```

This code is useful when we need to construct Path objects frequently for a remote file system. The power of the NIO.2 API here is that it lets us rely on the default file system for files and directories as before, while giving us the ability to build more complex applications that reference external file systems.

### Working with Legacy File Instances
When Path was added in Java 7, the legacy java.io.File class was updated with a new method, toPath(), that operates on an instance of File variable.

```
File file = new File("pandas/cuddly.png");
Path path = file.toPath();

```
For backwards compatibility, the Path interface also contains a method toFile() to return a File instance:

```
Path path = Paths.get("cuddlt.txt");
File file = path.toFile();

```

As you can see the Java API is quite flexible, and it allows easy conversion between legacy code using the File class and newer code using Path. Although Java suppors both methods for working with files, it is generally recommended that you rely on the Path API in your applications going forward as it is more feature rich and has built-in support for various file systems and symbolic links.

# Interacting with Paths and Files
Now that we've covered how to obtain an instance of the Path object, you might ask, what can we do with it? The NIO.2 API provides a rich plethora of methods and classes that operate on Path objects - far more that we are available in the java.io API. We will discuss the methods that you should know for the exam in this section.

**Path Object vs Actual File** One thing to keep in mind when reading this section is that a Path object is not a file but a prepresentation of a location within the file system. In this manner, most operations available in the Path and Paths classes can be accomplished  regardless of whether the underlying file that the Path object references actually exists. For example, retrieving the parent or root directory of a Path object does not require the file to exists, although the JVM may access the underlying file system to know how to process the path information.

As you shall see in this section, a handful of operations in the Path and Paths classes, such as Path.toRealPath() do require the file to exist and will throw a checked execption if the file is not available.

## Providing Optional Arguments
Throuout this section, we introduce numerous methods for interacting with files and directories in NIO.2. Many of the mehods in the NIO.2 API that interact with real files and directories take additional option flags in the form of a vararg. For the exam, you do not need to memorize which of the dozens of NIO.2 methods take which optional arguments, but you should be able to recognize what they do when you see them on the exam. The table below lists the values that you should know for the exam. Note that these descriptions apply to both files and directories. If you are not familiar with the operations to which these attributes apply, don't worry; we'll explain them later in this chapter.

![Common Optional Arguments in NIO.2](img/commonOptionalArgumentsNIO2.png)

For simplicity as well as better readability, we purposely omit the enum class names to which the values belong throughout the text, although we do include them in any practice questions. For example, the copy methods take a list of CopyOption interface values, of which StandardCopyOption is an enum that implements the intreface and includes StandardCopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES as an option. As we said, for simplicity, we omit these details as the exam won't require you to understand this relationship. The ATOMIC_VALUE might be new to you. An *atomic operation* is an operation that is performed as a single indivisable unit of execution, which appears to the rest of the system as occurring instantaneously. Furthermore, an atomic move is one in which any process monitoring the file system never sees an incomplete or partially written files. If the file system does not support this feature , an AtomicMoveNotSupportedException will be thrown. For the reminder of the chapter, we leave out these enumn values in the method definitions so that you can focus on the core functionality. For the exam, you should understand their effect if you see them providede to a method.    

## Using Path Objects
The Path interface includes numerous methods for using Path objects. You have alrady seen two of them, toFile() and toUri(), used to convert Path objects to other types of resources. Many of the methods in the Path interface transform the path value in some way and return a new Path object, allowing the method to be chained. We demonstrate chaning in the following example, the details of which we will discuss in this section of the chapter.

```
Paths.get("/zoo/../home").getParent().normalize().toAbsolutePath();
```
If you start to feel overwhelmed by the number of methods available in the Path interface, just remember: the function of many of them can be inferred by their method name, such as getParent(), getNameCount(), toAbsolutePath() and so on. In this section, we organize the methods by related functionality.

### Viewing the Path with toString(), getNameCount(), and getName()
The Path interface contains three methods to retrieve basic information about the path representative. The first method, toString() returns an String representation of en entire path. In fact, it is the only method in the Path interface to return a String. Most of the other methods that we will discuss in this section return a new Path object. The second and third methods, getNameCount() and getName(int) are often used in conjunction to retrieve the number of elements in the path and and a reference to each element, respectively. For greater compatibility with other NIO.2 methods, the getName(int) method returns the component of the Path as a new Path object rather than a String. 

The following sample code uses these methods to retrieve path data:

```
Path path = Paths.get("/land/hippo/harry.happy");
System.out.println("The path name is: " + path);

for(int i=0; i < path.getNameCount(); i++){
  System.out.println("Element " + i + " is: " + path.getName(i));
}

```

As you might remember from our discussion of PrintStream/PrintWriter in Chapter 8, printing an object automatically invokes the object's toString(). The output of this code snippet is the following:

```
The Path Name is : /land/hippo/harry.happy
  Element 0 is: land
  Element 1 is: hippo
  Element 2 is: harry.happy
```

Notice that the root element / is not included in the list of names. If the path object represents the root elements itself, then the number of names in the Path objects returned by getNameCount() will be 0. What if we ran the preceding code using the relative path land/hippo/harry.happy ? the output would be as follows:

```
The path name is: land/hippo/harry.happy
  Element 0 is: land
  Element 1 is: hippo
  Element 2 is: harry.happy
```
Notice that the individual names are the same. For the exam, you should be aware that the getName(int) method is zero-indexed, with the file system root executed from the path components

### Accesing Path Components with getFileName(), getParent(), and getRoot()
The Path interface contains numerous methods for retrieving specific information subelements of a Path object, returned as Path objects themselves. The first method, getFileName() returns a Path  instance representing the filename, which is the farthest element from the root.  Like most methods in the Path interface, getFileName() returns  a Path instance representing the parent paths or null if there us no such parent. If the instance of the Path object is relative, this method will stop at the top-level element defined in the Path object. In other words, it will not traverse outside the working directory to the file system root.
The last method getRoot() returns the root element for the Path object or null if the Path object is relative. We represent a sample application that traverses absolute and relative Path objects to show how each handles the root differently:

```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public class PathFilePathTest{
  public static void printPathInformation(Path path){
    
    System.out.println("File is: " + path.getFileName());
    System.out.println("Root is: " + path.getRoot());
    
    Path currentPath = path;
    while((currentParent = currentParent.getParent()) != null){
      System.out.println(" current parent is: " + currentParent);
    } 
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    printPathInformation(Paths.get("/zoo.armadillo/shells.txt"));
    System,out.println();
    printPathInformation("armadillo/shells.txt");
  }
}

```
The while loop in the printPathInformation() method continues until getParent() returns null. This sample application produces the following output:

```
File name is: shells.txt
Root is: /
  Current parent is: /zoo/armadillo
  Current parent is: /zoo
  Current parent is: /


File name is: shells.txt
Root is: null
  Current parent is: armadillo

```

Reviewing the sample output, you can see the difference in the behaviour of getRoot() on absolute and relative paths. Also notice that traversing the second path stopped at the top of the relative directory. As you can see in the example, it does not traverse relative directories outside of the working directory.

### Checking Path Type with isAbsolute() and toAbsolutePath()
The Path interface contains two methods for assisting with relative and absolute paths. The first method, isAbsolute() returns true if the path the object references is absolute and false if the path the object references is relative. 

The second method, toAbsolutePath() converts a relative Path object to an absolute Path object by joining  it to the current working directory. If the path object is already absolute, then the method just returns an equivalent copy of it.

The following code snippets shows usage of both of these methods:

```
Path path1 = Paths.get("C:\\birds\\egert.txt");
System.out.println("Path1 is absolute?" + path1.isAbsolute());
System.out.println("Absolute Path1: " + path1.toAbsolutePath());


Path path2 = Paths.get("birds/condor.txt");
System.out.println("Path2 is absolute?" + path2.isAbsolute());
System.out.println("Absolute Path2: " + path2.toAbsolutePath());
```
The output for the code snippet is shown in the following sample code. Since the precise output is file system dependent, we will treat the first example as beign run on windows based system, whereas the second example is run in a Linux or Mac based system with the current working directory of /home·

```
Path1 is Absolute? true
Absolute Path1: C:\birds\egret.txt

Path2 is Absolute? false
Absolute Path2 /home/birds/condor.txt

```

Keep in mind that if the Path object already represents an absolute path, then the putput is new Path object with the same value. As discussed earlier in this chapter, absolute and relative path types are actually file system dependent. In fact, you might be surprised by the output of the following lines of code on various operating systems:

```
System.out.println(Paths.get("/stripes/zebra.exe").isAbsolute());

System.out.println(Paths.get("c:/goats/Food.java").isAbsolute());

```
Although the first line outputs true on a Linux or Mac based system, it outputs false on a windows based system since it is missing a drive letter prefix. IN the same manner, the second path outputs true on Windows but false on a linux or mac systems, as it is missing the root slash /.

### Creating a New Path with subpath()
The method subpath(int,int) returns a relative subpath of a Path object, referenced by an inclusive start index and an exclusive end index. It is useful for constructing a new relative path from a particular parent path element to another parent path element, as shown in the following example.

```
Path path = Paths.get("/mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image");
System.out..println("Path is " + path);

System.out.println("Subpath from 0 to 3 is: " + path.subpath(0,3));
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 3 is: " + path.subpath(1,3));
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 2 is: " + path.subpath(1,2));

```

You might notice that the subpath() and getName(int) methods are similar in that they both return a Path object that represents a component of an exisiting Path. The difference is that the subpath() method may include multiple path components, whereas the getName(int) method only includes one. The output of this code snippet is the following:

```
Path is : /mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 0 to 3 is: mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 1 to 3 is: carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 1 to 2 is: carnivore
```

This code demonstrates that the subpath(int, int) method does not inlcude the root of the file. Notice that the 0-indexed element is mammal in this example and not the root directory: therefore, the maximum index that can be used is 3. The following two examples both throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at runtime:

```
System.out.println("Subpath from 0 to 4 is:" + path.subpath(0,4));  //THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 1 is:" + path.subpath(1,1));  //THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME

```

The first example throws an exception at runtime, since the maximum index value allowed is 3. The second example throws an exception since the start and end indexes are the same, elading to an empty value.

## Using Path Symbols
Many file systems support paths that contain relative path information in the form of path symbols. For example, you might want a path that refers to the parent directory, regardless of what a current directory is. In this scenario the double period value .. can be used to reference the parent directory. In addition, the single period value . can be used to reference the current directory within a path.

For example, the path value ../bear.txt refers to a file named bear.txt in the parent of the current directory. Likewise the path value ./penguin.txt refers to a file named penguin.txt in the curent directory. These symbols can also be combined for greater effect. For example, ../../lion.data refers to a file lion.data that is two directories up from the current working directory. 

### Delivering a Path with relativize()
The Path interface privides a method relativize(Path) for constructing the relative Path from one Path object to another. Consider the following relative and absolute path examples using the relativize() method.

```
Path path1 = Paths.get("fish.txt");
Path path2 = Paths.get("birds.txt");
System.out.println(path1.relativize(path2));
System.out.println(path2.relativize(path1));
```

The code snippet produces the following output when executed:

```
..\birds.txt
..\fish.txt
```
If both path values are relative, then the relativize() mehod computes the paths as if they are in the same current working directory. Notice that ../is included at the start of the first set of examples. Since our path value points to a file, we need to move to parent directory that contains the file.

Alternatively, if both path values are absolute, then the method computes the realtive path from one absolute location to another, regarless of the current working directory. The following example demonstrates this property:

```
Path path3 = Paths.get("E:\\habitat");
Path path4 = Paths.get("E:\\sanctuary\raven");
System.out.println(path3.relativize(path4));
System.out.println(path4.relativize(path3));
```

This code snippet produces the following output when executed:

```
..\sanctuary\raven
..\..\habitat
```

In this set of examples, the two path values are absolute, and the relativize() method constructs the relative path between the two absolute path values within the file system. Note that the file system is not accessed to perform this comparison. For example, the root path element E: may not exist in the file system, yet the code would execute without issue since Java is referencing the path elements and not the actual file values.

The relativize() method requires that both paths be absolute or both relative, and it will throw an IllegalArgumentException if a relative path value is mixed with an absolute path value. For exaample, the following would thorw an exception at runtime.

```
Path path1 = Paths.get("/primate/chimpanzee");
Path path2 = Paths.get("bananas.txt");
path1.relativize(path2);      // THROWS AN EXPECTION AT RUNTIME

```

On windows based systems, it also requires that if absolute paths are used, then both paths must have the same root directory or drive letter. For example, the following would also throw an IllegalArgumentException at runtime in a Windows based system since they use different roots:

```
Path path3 = Paths.get("c:\\primate\\chimpanzee.txt");
Path path4 = Paths.get("d:\\storage\\bananas.txt");
path3.relativize(path4);    //THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
```

### Joining Path Objects with resolve()
The Path interface includes a resolve(Path) method for creating a new Path by joining an existing path to the current path. To put it another way, the object on which the resolve() method is invoked becomes the basis of the new Path object, with the input argument being appended onto the Path. Let's see what happens if we apply resolve() to an absolute path and a relative path:

```
final Path path1 = Paths.get("/cats/../panther");
final Path path2 = Paths.get("food");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
```

The code snippet generates the following outputs:

``` /cats/../pather/food```

For the exam, yopu should be aware that, like the relativize() method, the resolve() method does not clean up path symbols, such as the parent durectory .. symbol. For that, you will need to use the normalize() method, which we will cover next. In this example, the input argument to the resolve() method  was a relative path, but what if had been an absolute path?

```
final Path path1 = Paths.get("/turkey/food");
final Path path2 = Paths.get("/tiger/cage");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
```

Since the input parameter path2 is an absolute path, the output would be the following:

``` /tiger/cage ```

For the exam, you should be cognizant of mixing absolute and relative paths with the resolve() method. If an absolute path is provided as input to the method, such as path1.reosolve(path2), then path1 would be ignored and a copy of path2 would be returned.

### Cleaning Up a Path with normalize()
As you saw with the relativize() method, file system can construct relative paths using .. and . values. There are times, however, when relative paths are combined such that there are redundancies in the path value. Luckily, Java provides us with the normalize(Path) method to eliminate the redundancies in the path.
For example, lets take the output of one of our previous examples that resulted in the path value ../user/home and try to reconsititute the original absolute path using the resolve() method:

```
Path path3 = Paths.get("E:\\data");
Path path4 = Paths.get("E:\\user\\home");

Path relativePath = path3.relativize(path4);
System.out.println(path3.resolve(relativePath));
```

The result of this sample code would be the following output:

``` E:\data\..\user\home ```

You can see that this path value contains a redundancy. Worse yet, it does not match our original value, E:\user\home. We can resolve this redundancy by applying the normalize() method as shown here:

```
System.out.println(path3.resolve(relativePath).normalize())
```

The modified last line of code nicely produces our original path value:

```
E:\user\home
```

Like relativize(), the normalize() method does not check that the file actually exists. As you shall see with our final Path  method, toRealPath(), Java provides a way to verify the file does exactly exist.

### Checking for File Existence with toRealPath()
The toRealPath(Path) method takes a Path object that may or may not point to an existing file within the file system, and it returns a reference to a real path within the file syste. It is similar to the toAbsolutePath() method in that it can convert a relative path to an absolute path except that it also verifies that the file referenced by the path actually exists, and thus it throws a checked IOException at runtime if the file cannot be located. It is also the only Path method to support the NOFOLLOW_LINKS option.
The toRealPath() method performs additional steps, such as removing redundant path elements. In other words, it implicitly calls normalize() on the resulting absolute path. 

Let's say that we have a file system in which we have a symbolic link from food.source to food.txt, as described in the following relationship:

```
/zebra/food.source -> /horse/food.txt
```

Assuming the our current working durectory is /horse/schedule, then consider the following code:

```java
try{
  System.out.println(Paths.get("/zebra/food.source").toRealPath());
  
  System.out.println(Paths.get(".././food.txt").toRealPath());
}catch(IOException e){
  //handle file I/O exception ...
}

```

Notice that we have to catch IOException, since unlike the toAbsolutePath() method, the toRealPath() method interacts with the file system to check if the path is valid. Given the symbolic link and current working directory as described, then the output would be the following:

```
/horse/food.txt

/horse/food.txt
```

In these examples, the absolute and relative paths both resolve to the same absolute file, as the symbolic link points to a rela file within the file system. Finally we can also use the toRealPath() method to gain access to the current working durectory such as shown here:

```
System.out.println(Paths.get(".").toRealPath());
```
## Interacting with Files
Great! We now have access to a Path object, and we can find out a ton of information about it, but what can we do with the file it references? For starters, many of the same operations available to java.nio.file.Path via a helper class called java.nio.file.Files. Unlike the methods in the Path and Paths class, most of the operations within the Files class will throw an exception if the file to which the Path refers does not exist.

**Be wary of File vs Files on the exam** as you saw earlier with Path and Paths, Java is fond of singular names for container classes and plural names for factory and helper classes. In this situation, though, the NIO.2 Files hlper class is in no way related to the File class, as Files class operates on Path instances, not File instances. Kepp in mind that File belongs to the legacy java.io API, while Files belong to the NIO.2 API.

The Files class contains numerous static methods for interacting  with files, with most taking one or two Path objects as arguments. Some of these methods are capable of throwing the checked IOExcepotion at runtime, often when the file referenced does nit exist within the file system, as you saw with Path method toRealPath().

### Testing a Path with exists()
The Files.exists(Path) method takes a Path object and returns true if, and only ifg, it references a file that exists in the file system.

Let's take a look at some sample code:

```
Files.exists(Paths.get("/ostrich/feathers.png"));

Files,exists(Paths.get("/ostrich"));

```

The first example checkes wheather a file exists, while the second example checkes whether a directory exists. You can see that this method does not throw an expection if the file does not exists, as doing so would prevent this method from ever running false at runtime.

### Testing uniqueness with isSameFile()
The Files.siSameFile(Path,Path) method is useful for determining if two Path objects relate to the same file within the same file system. It takes two Path objects as input and follows symbolic links. Despite the name, the method also determines if two Path objects refer to the same directory.

The isSameFile() method first checks if the Path objects are equal in termns of equal(), and if so, it automatically returns true without checking to see if either file exists. If the Path object equals() comparison returns false, then it locates each file to which the path refers in the file system and determines if they are the same, throwing a checked IOException if either file doest not exist. Note that the method does not compare the content of the file. For example two files may have indetical content and attributes, but if they are in different locations, then this method will return false.

Let's assume that all of the files in the following examples exists within the file system and that cobra is a symbolic link to the snake file. What would be the output of the following code snippet?

```
try{
  System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/user/home/cobra"), Paths.get("/user/home/snake")));
  
  System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/user/tree/../monkey"), Paths.get("/user/monkey")));
  
  System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/leaves/./girafe.exe"), Paths.get("/leaves/giraffe.exe")));
  
  System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/flamingo/tail.data"), Paths.get("/cardinal/tail.data")));

}catch(IOException e){
  //handle file I/O expcetion
}

```

Since cobra is a symbolic link to the snake file, the first example outputs true. In the second example, the symbol .. cancels out the tree path of the paths, resulting in the method, so the results is true as well. In the third example, the symbol . leave the path unmodified, so the result is tru as well. The final example returns false, asuming that neither file is a synbolic link to the other. Even if the files have the same name and the same contents, if they are different locations, they are considered different files within the file system.
